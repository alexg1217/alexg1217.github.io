      <h3>A Look Back at a Sweet Season: 'Canes B-Ball</h3>

        <p>Although the Miami’s men’s basketball season came to an end over a week ago, the NCAA season didn’t end until Villanova’s win against North Carolina Monday night.</p>

        <p>The Hurricanes made the Sweet 16 for only the third time in program history this season (2000 and 2013 being the other two). While the 2012-13 team won both the ACC Regular Season and Tournament titles, the 2015-16 edition made their own mark on the ‘Canes faithful.</p>

        <p>To cover the season adequately, I’ve gone through the games and have decided on presenting one or two cases of the following: The Good of the season, The Bad of the season, The Top Performances, The Top Moments, as well as a Look Forward to the future of Miami basketball.</p>

        <p>Now, without further ado…</p>

        <p class="name">THE GOOD:</p>

        <p>Senior shooting guard Sheldon McClellan:</p>

        <p>McClellan began his Miami career as a transfer from Texas. He ended it as one of the most consistent players in Miami basketball history, with a Sweet 16 appearance to boot.</p>

        <p>McClellan scored in double digits in all but three games this season for an average of 16.3 PPG (points per game),  best on the team, and made acrobatic plays throughout the year. Those three games with under 10 points all came before the New Year.</p>

        <p>McClellan scored a season-high 27 points against then No. 16 Utah in November. He scored 26 points, with 5-7 shooting on three’s, in Miami’s Sweet 16 matchup with Villanova. His five three’s against Villanova was his highest total on the year.</p>

        <p>Just as impressive as his consistent scoring was his ability to make the shots he took. His 54.5% field goal percentage was the best on the team and the best in the ACC among guards.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj-GrTLtQpI"> Check out some highlights of McClellan while you’re at it.</a> Oh, and, since you are at it, marvel at that athleticism. (Video courtesy of Canes Film)</p>



        <p>The BUC:</p>

        <p>Miami lost only one game at the homely BankUnited Center. Northeastern got the win on a last second shot all the way back in November to hand Miami a 78-77 loss.</p>

        <p>The ‘Canes would be perfect at home the rest of the way, including thrilling victories against No. 24 Duke (80-69), No. 3 Virginia (64-61), and No. 11 Louisville (73-65). All rankings were current at the time the games were played. Video recaps of those games can be found <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400839768">here</a> (Duke), <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400830497">here</a> (Virginia), and <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/game?gameId=400839806">here</a> (Louisville).</p>

        <p>The home win-streak – currently at 13 games – included back-to-back two-point wins, first against Pittsburgh (65-63) and then against Florida St. (67-65).</p>

        <p>What was the largest margin of victory at home? That would be a 46-point thrashing of La Salle on December 22, just in time for the holidays.</p>

        <p class="name">THE BAD:</p>

        <p>The losses. All of them, basically, were ugly. Miami only lost one game by three points or less, being the loss to Northeastern, for an overall away record of 6-5.</p>

        <p>The next two Miami losses came back-to-back and, of course, were on the road. First came the eight-point loss to Virginia on January 12. Four days later Miami lost in South Carolina to Clemson by 11 points. That would be a Clemson team that finished the year with a 17-14 record. The ‘Canes were ranked No. 8 in the country at the time, their highest ranking until the final week of the season (where they were ranked No. 7). A two-point halftime lead dissipated thanks to a second-half in which they were outscored by 13 points.</p>

        <p>Exactly two weeks later the ‘Canes lost to lowly North Carolina St. by 16 points. NC State finished the year 16-17, better than only two other teams in the ACC.</p>

        <p>The state of North Carolina wasn’t kind to Miami, as the ‘Canes lost by 25 points to the eventual NCAA runner-up Tar Heels in February.</p>

        <p>Finally, Miami lost at Virginia Tech by 15 points in the season finale. If there was one game Miami could get back this season, this would have to be it. The loss arguably cost Miami a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Instead, the ‘Canes were a three-seed in a region that included two de facto number one seeds, Kansas and eventual-national champ Villanova, whom the NCAA gave a two-seed.</p>

        <p class="name">TOP PERFORMANCES:</p>

        <p>Finishing tied for second-place in the ACC undoubtedly yields some fine individual performances. Here are the top three of the year:</p>

        <p>Davon Reed against Virginia:</p>

        <p>The junior guard had a career-game against the No. 3 Cavaliers. He was the biggest ‘Cane contributor with 21 points on 6-8 shooting, including 5-6 from three. The 21 points were a career-high.</p>

        <p>Every time Miami needed a big shot, Reed stepped in. He scored the first six points for Miami on two three pointers in what was a sign of things to come. With the ‘Canes clinging to a five-point lead, Reed knocked down another triple before going on to make a pair of free-throws to effectively clinch the game and give Miami their biggest win of the year, 64-61.</p>

        <p>Some highlights of that performance are <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400830497">here.</a></p>

        <p>Angel Rodriguez against Wichita St.:</p>

        <p>With a place in the Sweet 16 on the line, point guard Angel Rodriguez gave Miami arguably the best performance of his career against the Wichita St. Shockers. The senior scored a career-high 28 points, including 3-6 from downtown, while dishing out five assists.</p>

        <p>His impact wasn’t felt on offense only. As he had all year, Rodriguez was around the ball on defense with his all-out style of play. His four steals against Wichita St. helped Miami fend off a furious Shockers rally and send the ‘Canes to their third Sweet 16 all-time with a 65-57 win.</p>

        <p>As always, highlights are <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400872163">here.</a></p>

        <p>Anthony Lawrence Jr. against Notre Dame:</p>

        <p>The freshman guard had a breakout game against the Fighting Irish to help Miami bounce back from their hideous loss to NC State in the previous game. Lawrence Jr. gave Miami a crucial 18 points off the bench in a 79-70 win.</p>

        <p>In the 20 games leading up to the Notre Dame bout, Lawrence Jr. averaged just over three PPG. The 18 points was a season-high. He also connected on all four of his three-point attempts. The four made three’s were also a season-high.</p>

        <p>Did someone say <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400839243">highlights?</a></p>

        <p class="name">THE OUT OF NOWHERE PLAY OF THE YEAR:</p>

        <p>As with the top performances of the year, there are many candidates for plays of the year. Honorable mentions include every alley-oop thrown (they were all great), McClellan’s two running halftime buzzer-beaters, and every successful Tonye Jekiri post-move.</p>

        <p>The winner is the last-second tip-in by Rodriguez that eked out a 65-63 win for the ‘Canes against Pittsburgh. It was a wild sequence at the end leading up to the game-winner.</p>

        <p>With seven seconds left and the game and the score tied, Rodriguez dished the ball out to an open McClellan at the three-point line. His shot missed off the rim and bounced straight up into the air. A high-flying Reed came in on the follow-up but missed as well. The ball bounced off a Pitt player’s hand and back up into the air.</p>

        <p>Enter Rodriguez. Hidden in a mass of bigger bodies, the five foot 11 inch Rodriguez out-jumped them all to get a hand on the ball and put it through the hoop. The win left Miami at 19-4 on the season.</p>

        <p>See it for yourself <a href="http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/video?gameId=400839225">here.</a></p>

        <p class="name">A LOOK FORWARD:</p>

        <p>Yes, Miami has several key seniors leaving, including Rodriguez, McClellan, and Jekiri. However, there is reason to remain optimistic about the potential of the program. Miami has a five-star and two four-star recruits, according to 247 Sports, coming to Coral Gables next season.</p>

        <p>The five-star recruit is forward Dewan Huell out of Miami Norland High School. Huell is the 25th ranked player in his class, standing at six feet 10 inches. The forward should help Miami maintain their  defensive inside presence. Highlights <a href="http://247sports.com/player/dewan-huell-29174/videos?Institution=24013">here.</a></p>

        <p>Four-star recruit Bruce Brown will be coming to Miami from Vermont Academy in Saxton’s River, Vermont. As a shooting guard, look for him to one day take over McClellan’s duties as primary scorer and playmaker. Brown stand six feet four inches tall. Highlights <a href="http://247sports.com/player/bruce-brown-38700/videos?Institution=24013">here.</a></p>

        <p>Finally, Rodney Miller fills out the 2016 Miami recruiting class. The center is from Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, and stands at six feet eleven inches. He has a nice post-game, as can be seen <a href="http://247sports.com/player/rodney-miller-33657/videos?Institution=24013">here.</a></p>


        <p>That’s it for the 2015-16 Miami Hurricanes. Am I the only one excited for next year?</p>

        <p>I can’t be.</p>

      <h3>May the Best (Athlete) Win</h3>
        <p>The election season is building momentum. Thirteen states will go to the polls as part of Super Tuesday. We’ve already heard everything we can possibly hear about each of the candidates thanks to the seemingly weekly debates on TV (CNN may beg to differ, however).</p>

        <p>It’s time someone gives you a look at the candidates through an entirely different lens in order to help you with making that vote.</p>

        <p>What other event in the U.S., other than the presidential election, brings two separate groups of people together and proceeds to pitch them against one another in a winner-take-all fight to the death? Okay, maybe the election isn’t that serious, but the answer I was looking for, is sports!</p>

        <p>The major sports leagues have been around long enough now for specific player trends to arise and become known.</p>

        <p>There’s been the big, physical quarterback in football. In basketball there’s the old head that always makes you ask yourself, “he’s still in the league?,” because he does one thing really well and consistently. We’ve seen the slim leadoff man in baseball who’s coveted because of his crafty, scrappy play.</p>

        <p>The candidates would have fallen into one of the existing trends had they chosen a path of blisters and ankle braces over hearings and filibusters. Use this information wisely.</p>

        <p class="name">Hillary Clinton</p>

        <p>Let’s start with the democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Okay, the fun is officially over. Clinton is the San Antonio Spurs of politics.</p>

        <p>Counting her time as first lady, Clinton has been in office since 1992. The Spurs have been a perennial playoff contender since the early 1990s in their own right. Through the years, Clinton has built a reputation for being politically correct. On the same note, when has anyone on the Spurs said anything remotely interesting, let alone controversial?</p>

        <p>In the end, both Clinton and the Spurs have benefited from their unexciting methods.</p>

        <p>Clinton, of course, went straight from the office of the first lady to a U.S. senator from New York, followed by a period as secretary of the state. The Spurs won four NBA championships over the same time-period.</p>

        <p>Clinton was defeated in her 2008 presidential election bid by a man with a nice jumpshot who was popular with the younger crowd. The Spurs lost the 2013 NBA Finals to LeBron James. The Spurs came back to win the title the following year.</p>

        <p>Only time will tell if Clinton can do the same.</p>

        <p class="name">Bernie Sanders</p>

        <p>Every ball team needs an old timer on the bench or in the locker room. Bernie Sanders is the old timer on the democratic bench. Yes, Bernie Sanders helps coach the democratic national basketball team.</p>

        <p>How has he been able to stay on board for so long?</p>

        <p>He has proven to make great ties with the younger generation of players. Unlike many old ball coaches, who harken back to how great the game was in their day, Sanders keeps both eyes to the future.</p>

        <p>The one man that sticks in his craw time and time again? That Stephen Curry kid. How dare he knock down game-winners 40 feet away (it was actually 32, but, is that even a big difference at this point?) from the basket! Sanders knows he can’t do anything about that.</p>

        <p>Instead, Bernie wants to make it easier for the rest of us by moving the three-point line closer to the hoop. Why should Curry be the only one to enjoy the spoils of the three ball so frequently and with unprecedented ease? Curry is definitely in the 1% on this one.</p>

        <p>Sanders wants to redistribute the wealth of three’s out there to the rest of the league. Everyone should be able to reap the rewards of the higher value three-pointer.</p>

        <p>Who wouldn’t want this kind of progressive change, where everyone can feel like Curry?</p>

        <p class="name">Donald Trump</p>

        <p>Now in the game for the republicans, The Donald. Donald trump is the frontrunner in the republican race; but how did he get there?</p>

        <p>Since day one, he has lined up and come on a downhill blitz to split the tackle and guard (untouched) and smack the rest of the republican field in the backfield. Loss of four on the play.</p>

        <p>trump is the prototypical linebacker. He’s in the middle of it all on each and every play – unless Megyn Kelly is the quarterback – and is unafraid of anyone across from him.</p>

        <p>He’s bruising. He has an attacking style of play. Plus, he’s an intimidator. Just ask Jeb Bush.</p>

        <p class="name">Marco Rubio</p>

        <p>If you don’t know by now, Marco Rubio is the man the republican establishment wants to own Super Tuesday. There’s only one problem; the man is a flopper. Not a flip-flopper, but a fútbol flopper!</p>

        <p>Anyone who has watched even twenty seconds of soccer knows one thing; all soccer players have the instinct to fall for no apparent reason, no matter what the situation. It is the one thing they practice at all times.</p>

        <p>The same goes for Rubio and his stump speech. It doesn’t matter whether he’s being asked about the economy or ISIS. He just knows, that Obama knows, exactly what he’s doing. When in doubt, stump!</p>

        <p>The same goes for the soccer player. One ex-fútballer told me what would go on in his head over the course of a match:</p>

        <p class="quote">Drop of sweat just hit me in the face, jerk backward and fall to the ground! Clutch my face with both hands like I had just taken a club to the nose! Keep rolling around like the pain is excruciating! No call? I guess I’ll have to throw in a yelp next time.</p>

        <p>Anyone who watches Rubio for twenty seconds knows one thing; Obama knows what he’s doing.</p>

        <p class="name">Trump!</p>

        <p>trump! This guy again? Yes, it is possible to fit more than one characterization. For trump, it is very easy.</p>

        <p>When trump isn’t slamming into something, anything, really, he’s busy behind the plate. No, not that plate, with the turkey leg and mashed potatoes on it, the one used in baseball!</p>

        <p>trump is the umpire no one ever wants to have call their ballgame. If you strike out, guess who’s right there to let you know about it. He will let everyone know about it. He’s going to drag that call out and punch it out like it’s the last time, every time.</p>

        <p>We can already picture the joy on his face under the mask with each punchout. For that matter, I’m pretty sure we’ve already seen it on ‘The Apprentice.'</p>

        <p>Plus, forget about arguing any of his calls. Managers are better off staying in the dugout until the next series when a new umpire crew takes over. Not everyone does, however. According to several sources, trump and a manager got into it during a Spring Training game recently:</p>

        <p class="quote">“Don’t even think about coming over here! Alright that’s it, you’rrrrrre fired! Oh, that’s not enough for ya’? You can expect paperwork from my lawyer’s in the morning! You can’t question my balls and strikes and not expect to be sued for defamation!”</p>

        <p>Those same sources tell me no official paperwork has been filed yet.</p>

        <p class="name">Ted Cruz</p>

        <p>The last of the republican’s is Ted Cruz. He’s the one person who never gives the opponent the benefit of the doubt.</p>

        <p>Think that down-the-line backhand was in? Not while Cruz is on the other side of the net. That second serve? Nope, that easily missed by a couple of inches. Don’t even bother to ask him if he’s sure, Ted Cruz is always sure that your ball was out.</p>

        <p>Word on the campaign trail is Cruz likes to engage in pickup basketball from time to time. Who already holds the world record for most foul calls in a single pickup game? That would be Ted Cruz.</p>

        <p>In case anyone forgot, the only fouls in pickup basketball are the ones that you call on other people for fouling you. That’s right, Ted Cruz calls all of the fouls. Let’s just imagine what that might sound like:</p>

        <p class="quote">“Just keep breathing on my neck while I try to hit these layups. I’ll be calling it all day.”</p>

        <p>Or…</p>

        <p class="quote">"What do you mean it’s not a foul for making contact with me once the shot was up? You can’t affect my follow-through like that!”</p>

        <p>I don’t want to imagine how the handshake with Vladimir Putin would turn out. Or maybe on second thought…</p>

        <p>Either the dust will settle after Tuesday or it will turn to a sandstorm.</p>

        <p>Whoever can drain a three from half-court in the midst of the madness will earn my vote.</p>

      <h3>Miami With Second Straight Weekend Sweep</h3>
        <p>For the second weekend in a row, the Miami Hurricanes baseball team swept their opponent and in the process won their 18th game in their last 20 tries.</p>

        <p>Last week’s victim was the Clemson Tigers. It was the North Carolina Tar Heels this time around as Miami recorded wins on Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday afternoon.</p>

        <p>Thomas Woodrey (3-2) helped pitch Miami to a 10-4 victory in game one of the series. The senior went seven innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs. It was Woodrey’s first win since a March 4 contest with Manhattan.</p>

        <p>Six ‘Canes finished the game with multiple hits as Miami finished with 15 in all. An early 1-0 deficit was erased in the bottom of the second inning on a Carl Chester RBI single.</p>

        <p>The 1-1- tie would last until Miami put four runs up on the scoreboard in the fifth. The inning could have been even larger had Miami not left the bases loaded to end the inning.</p>

        <p>Three runs in the sixth and two in the eighth finished the job for the ‘Canes.</p>

        <p>Game two saw Miami go behind early for the second night in a row before coming back to win 7-3. ‘Canes starter Michael Mediavilla (5-0) allowed two runs in the top of the second on a home run and sacrifice fly, both to right field.</p>

        <p>It took only until the bottom of the third for Miami to break the game open.</p>

        <p>First-baseman Christopher Barr singled in two runs before shortstop Brandon Lopez doubled in three. Lopez led all batters with 3 hits on the day, going 3-4.</p>

        <p>Mediavilla kept the Tar Heels off the board for five innings until he allowed a home run in the eighth. Mediavilla stayed in for one more batter but hit him on a full count pitch, prompting coach Jim Morris to replace him with righty Frankie Bartow.</p>

        <p>Bartow retired two in a row to end the inning and the last Tar Heel scoring threat.</p>

        <p>The second-straight Sunday Sweep was capped with a 7-4 come-from-behind victory, the third in as many days for the ‘Canes.</p>

        <p>Once again, North Carolina got the scoring started in the second inning, scoring three runs on Miami starter Danny Garcia (no decision).</p>

        <p>The Miami hitters were kept at bay through four innings. The ‘Canes claimed the lead with a five run fifth and didn’t look back.</p>

        <p>Left-fielder Jacob Heyward hit a bases loaded double to center field that drove in a pair to score Miami’s first runs of the day. Heyward advanced to third on a wild pitch – Barr scored on the play – before he was batted in on a sacrifice fly from second-baseman Johnny Ruiz.</p>

        <p>The ‘Canes tacked on two more in the eighth and closer Bryan Garcia (9) got the save half an inning later. Chester led Miami with 3 hits (3-4).</p>

        <p>Miami (23-4, and now ranked No. 2 in the nation) travels to Fort Myers, Fla. Tuesday for a single game against Florida Gulf Coast (13-15). The ‘Canes move on to play the Notre Dame Fighting Irish (15-11) in South Bend, Ind. In a three-game series over the weekend.</p>

      <h3>Miami Sweeps Clemson with Two Walkoffs</h3>
        <p>When the Miami Hurricanes “played“the Clemson Tigers in football this past season, a man lost his job because the end result was so bad. That man was former-head coach Al Golden. The score was 58-0 Clemson, a historic defeat for the Hurricanes football program.</p>

        <p>The Miami basketball team fared if only slightly better when they faced the Tigers. The ‘Canes went in to the game ranked no. 8 in the country, their highest ranking of the season up to that point (they would go as high as no. 7). Miami came out of the game with a ten-point defeat, one of several bad losses on the year, while seeing their ranking slip to no. 15.</p>

        <p>The No. 4 Miami Hurricanes baseball team made sure a similar outcome wasn’t in store for them, sweeping the kryptonite Tigers in a three-game weekend series at Mark Light Field in Coral Gables, Fla.</p>

        <p>Friday’s game one went the way of the ‘Canes when right-fielder Willie Abreu sent a two-run walk-off homer over the left field wall with Miami down by one. It was the Abreu’s second consecutive Friday night walk-off homer.</p>

        <p>Miami went down by two runs early in the game before putting up five runs in the bottom of the fourth. The inning was aided by a dropped fly ball and two close-calls – one at first and another at second on a steal – that went Miami’s way.</p>

        <p>Starting pitcher Thomas Woodrey went five and a third innings with one earned run before he was replaced by Andrew Cabezas.</p>

        <p>Closer Bryan Garcia (2-0) entered the game with a 7-5 lead to protect but allowed three runs bridging the eighth and ninth innings, surrendering the lead to the Tigers.<p>

        <p>Enter Abreu, and the rest is history. ‘Canes win, 9-8.</p>

      <h3>Miami is Going to the Sweet 16</h3>
        <p>The Miami Hurricanes men’s basketball team is in the Sweet 16.</p>

        <p>The third-seeded ‘Canes advanced with a 65-57 win against the 11th-seeded Wichita St. Shockers Saturday in Providence, R.I. in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.</p>

        <p>Senior guard Angel Rodriguez took over the game early and late for Miami en route to scoring a career-high 28 points. Rodriguez started 7-7 shooting while adding two steals in the early going, helping the ‘Canes build a 21 point lead a little over halfway through the first half.</p>

        <p>Apparently, he felt this kind of game coming, telling his teammates a calm came over him before the game, according to Miami coach Jim Larrañaga.</p>

        <p>It was a two-man show for Miami, just as it was against Buffalo in round one. Sheldon McClellan was the other man, scoring 18 points on 5-11 shooting, including two three’s.</p>

        <p>Miami’s ticket to the Sweet 16 appeared to be punched before the second half even began.</p>

        <p>In the NCAA Tournament, however, no lead is safe, and the Wichita St. defense entered the game allowing 59.3 points per game, the fewest in the country.</p>

        <p>The ‘Canes offense slowed down to bridge the first and second halves, as the game turned to a slugfest.</p>

        <p>Wichita St. cut Miami’s lead to 13 with the help of a 11-0 run. The Shockers kept the pressure on in the second as well, but the ‘Canes came prepared to exchange blows.</p>

        <p>Forward Kamari Murphy continued to be a defensive presence as he recorded two blocks and two steals for Miami. Murphy also had a game-high seven rebounds.</p>

        <p>Rodriguez picked up a steal early in the second half when he swiped the ball away from a driving Shocker. When the ball ricocheted, he hit the deck to keep a Shocker from getting his hands on it, and managed to find an open teammate in the process.</p>

        <p>Wichita St. came all the way back to hold their first lead of the afternoon, 43-42, 10 minutes in to the second half. The comeback was fueled by 20 second chance points stemming from a 16-2 offensive rebound difference in favor of Wichita St.</p>

        <p>Even with the disparity, the lead lasted all of 57 seconds before the ‘Canes took it back for good on a fastbreak dunk by McClellan.</p>

        <p>Fending off another Shockers run, Miami finally began to pull away.</p>

        <p>Guard Davon Reed swatted a Shocker from behind on a Wichita St. fastbreak opportunity and got the ball for Miami. Seconds later, Reed struck from behind the arc, his second three of the game, to put Miami up seven with just under five minutes left. Reed finished with 10 points.</p>

        <p>An Angel got the scoring started for Miami. That same Angel wielded the dagger that ended the Shockers season.</p>

        <p>With the ‘Canes up two, Rodriguez hit a wild layup high off the backboard late in the shot clock to put Miami up four, 57-53. The game’s MVP came back to knock down a triple on the next possession to seal the win.</p>

        <p>“He’s just an incredible floor general,” Larrañaga said after the game. “He does everything we ask him to do and then some.”</p>

        <p>Rodriguez scored the final 10 points for Miami.</p>

        <p>Game.</p>
